            <h3 align="justify"><strong> A coffee bean is a seed of the Coffea plant and the source for coffee. 
            It is the pit inside the red or purple fruit often referred to as a cherry. 
            Just like ordinary cherries, the coffee fruit is also a so-called stone fruit. 
            Even though the coffee beans are not technically beans, they are referred to 
            as such because of their resemblance to true beans. The fruits; coffee cherries 
            or coffee berries, most commonly contain two stones with their flat sides 
            together. A small percentage of cherries contain a single seed, instead of the 
            usual two. This is called a "peaberry". The peaberry occurs only between 10% 
            and 15% of the time, and it is a fairly common (yet scientifically unproven) 
            belief that they have more flavor than normal coffee beans. Like Brazil nuts 
            (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans consist mostly of endosperm.

            The two most economically important varieties of coffee plant are the Arabica 
            and the Robusta; ~60% of the coffee produced worldwide is Arabica and ~40% is 
            Robusta. Arabica beans consist of 0.8–1.4% caffeine and Robusta beans 
            consist of 1.7–4.0% caffeine. As coffee is one of the world's most widely 
            consumed beverages, coffee beans are a major cash crop and an important export 
            product, accounting for over 50% of some developing nations' foreign exchange 
            earnings. In 2017, 70% of total coffee production was exported, worth USD 19 billion.
